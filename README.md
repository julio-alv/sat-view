# sat-view

A simple program that shows in the predicted positions of the ISS using raylib and rust

Note: this is not realtime data, this just uses example TLE data I found on the internet

# Requirements (to build raylib)
- cmake
- glfw
- curl

# Running the project
- `cargo run` or `cargo run release` <- Usually better performance
